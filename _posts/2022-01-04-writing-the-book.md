title: Writing _Techniques for High School Mathematics Contests_

_Techniques for High School Mathematics Contests_ is the first book I have written. It is a result from the many years of training high school students in preparing national contests such as the OMK, IMONST, Chen Jing-Run cup, Hua Lo-Geng cup etc. In this book, I explore with the reader several techniques and concepts that are somewhat useful in these contests, assuming the reader has basic understanding of high school maths. This book, however, is not sufficient to prepare the reader for olympiad-level contests. It is also a great book for maths enthusiasts to learn about advanced topics such as complex numbers, calculus, vector geometry etc. 

[Here](../tristanchaang.github.io/downloads/The_Book.pdf) is a preview of the book. If you're interested in the book, please do email me and I will reply as soon as possible.
