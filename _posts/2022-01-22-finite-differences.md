title: Finite Differences (Attached)
---

I first encountered finite differences in the book _Numerical Analysis_ by Francis Scheid, and I think it is a fascinating concept. Not only it is useful in computer science; it is also useful in many ways for olympiad style mathematics. Its definition is simple: $f(x+1)-f(x)$, but the properties are endless. Here, I compiled some techniques used in problem solving that involve finite differences: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristanchaang/tristanchaang.github.io/main/downloads/Finite-Differences.pdf" download>Click here</a>.
